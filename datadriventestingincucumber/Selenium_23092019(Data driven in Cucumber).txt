The Scenario Outline keyword can be used to run the same Scenario multiple times, with different combinations of values.

A Scenario Outline must contain an Examples (or Scenarios) section.

Hooks are blocks of code that can run at various points in the Cucumber execution cycle.

---> Hooks are typically used for setup and teardown of the environment before and after each scenario.

Scenario hooks: Scenario hooks run for every scenario.

Before hooks run before the first step of each scenario.

@Before
public void doSomethingBefore() 
{
  ===
}

After hooks run after the last step of each scenario, even when steps are failed, undefined, pending, or skipped.

@After
public void doSomethingAfter()
{
    // Do something after after scenario
}

Tagged hooks: To run a particular hook only for certain scenarios, you can associate a Before or After Hook with a tag expression.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Background allows you to add some context to the scenarios in the feature. It can contain one or more Given steps.

A Background is run before each scenario, but after any Before hooks. In your feature file, put the Background before the first Scenario.

You can only have one set of Background steps per feature. If you need different Background steps for different scenarios, you’ll need to split them into different feature files.
